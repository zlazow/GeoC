Add any ideas of what needs to be added and changed

To run:
sudo g++ -I/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.11/Headers -L/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/lib -lgdal [ComputeNDVI.cpp or metadata.cpp]

./a.out

Overall:
-Add a Makefile
-Add connected component thing

ComputeNDVI:
-Fix CreateCopy in "ComputeNDVI.cpp" so that it only has 1 band instead of how many.

Stratton Ideas:
gaussian mixture model estimation:
-categories of things
-each category has some base value, but they all have noise
-data is a mixture 
-what is the probability that one pixel is in any of the gaussians?

grab-cut model
-look at how they use max-flow object
